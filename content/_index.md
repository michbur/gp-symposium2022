# About 

The Genomics Platform@WUT was established on 11-05-2020 to integrate and promote the genomics-oriented community at Warsaw University of Technology. Coordinated by a Scientific Advisory Board headed by Dariusz Plewczyński (Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics), Genomics Platform@WUT consists of six research groups with diverse research areas:

1. Dariusz Plewczyński (Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics).
2. Robert Nowak (Artificial Intelligence Division).
3. Przemysław Biecek (MI2 Data Lab).
4. Małgorzata Adamczyk (Laboratory of Systems and Synthetic Biology).
5. Tomasz Gambin (biodatageeks).
6. Krzysztof Kaczmarski (GPU Programming Team).

Secretary of the Scientific Advisory Board: Michał Burdukiewicz.

The Platform is open to both experimental and computational scientists interested in genomics. It aims to integrate the genomics-oriented community of Warsaw University of Technology and promote its achievements.

### Machine Learning in Computational Biology

**Abstract:** In this talk, we will focus on some Machine Learning Solutions in Computational Biology. In particular, we will first focus on a method of microRNA target prediction. Next, we will show its utilization for building a microRNA induced gene regulatory network, whose analysis reveals some novel markers for breast and colon cancer. We will then provide a brief overview of a single cell RNA-seq data clustering algorithm. Finally, we will conclude with an application of optimization technique for the drug design problem.

### Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare

**Abstract:** In this lecture first we will discuss some current trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will briefly introduce advantages of Deep Learning Techniques and In this regard we will demonstrate applications of different machine learning algorithms including Deep Learning in real life situation. We will demonstrate how Deep Learning Techniques and Graph Neural Network.  Subsequently we will demonstrate how these techniques can be used for healthcare applications.
